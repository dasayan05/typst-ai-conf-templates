= Submission of papers to NeurIPS 2023

Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully. *Important:* This year the checklist will be submitted separately from the main paper in OpenReview, please review it well ahead of the submission deadline: #link("https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist").

== Style

Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2023 must be prepared according to the instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to *nine* pages long, including figures. Additional pages #emph[containing only acknowledgments and references] are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.

The margins in 2023 are the same as those in previous years.

Authors are required to use the NeurIPS LaTeX or #emph[Typst] style files obtainable at the NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
rejection.

== Retrieval of style files

The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on the website at

The file `neurips_2023.pdf` contains these instructions and illustrates the various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.

The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2023 is `neurips_2023.sty` or `neurips.typ`. #strong[Previous style files for `\LaTeX2.09`, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!]

= General formatting instructions

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default. Paragraphs are separated by $1/2$~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.
